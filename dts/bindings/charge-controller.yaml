      Internal reference temperature at full load (째C)

      This value is used for model-based control of overcurrent protection. It represents
      the steady-state internal temperature for max. continuous current at ambient
      temperature of 25째C. Default value is conservative and can be overwritten in PCB
      configuration.

      Maximum Tj of MOSFETs (째C)

      This value is used for model-based control of overcurrent protection. It represents
      the steady-state junction temperature for max. continuous current at ambient
      temperature of 25째C.

      Thermal time constant junction to ambient (s)

      This value is used for model-based control of overcurrent protection. It does not reflect
      the much lower MOSFET-internal time constant junction to case, but includes thermal
      inertia of the board.

      Around 5s seems to be a good conservative estimation for 5x6 type SMD MOSFETs. Take larger
      values for big heat sinks.
