description: Half bridge, consisting of two coupled PWM outputs

compatible: "half-bridge"

include: base.yaml

properties:
    frequency:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: PWM frequency in Hz

    deadtime:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: Dead time for synchronous PWM generation in nanoseconds

    pinctrl-0:
      type: phandles
      required: false
      description: |
        GPIO pin configuration for PWM signal/s. We expect that the phandles
        will reference pinctrl nodes, e.g.

           pinctrl-0 = <&tim1_ch1_pwm_pa8 &tim1_ch2_pwm_pa9>;
