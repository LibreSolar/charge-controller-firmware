      Internal reference temperature at full load (°C)

      This value is used for model-based control of overcurrent protection. It represents
      the steady-state internal temperature for max. continuous current at ambient
      temperature of 25°C. Default value is conservative and can be overwritten in PCB
      configuration.

      Maximum Tj of MOSFETs (°C)

      This value is used for model-based control of overcurrent protection. It represents
      the steady-state junction temperature for max. continuous current at ambient
      temperature of 25°C.

      Thermal time constant junction to ambient (s)

      This value is used for model-based control of overcurrent protection. It does not reflect
      the much lower MOSFET-internal time constant junction to case, but includes thermal
      inertia of the board.

      Around 5s seems to be a good conservative estimation for 5x6 type SMD MOSFETs. Take larger
      values for big heat sinks.
